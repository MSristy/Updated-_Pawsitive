# 🐾 Pawsitive - Pet Adoption & Support Platform

**Pawsitive** is a pet adoption and support platform built to connect adopters with shelters, rescue groups, and rehomers. The goal is simple: make adoption easier, promote responsible pet ownership, and support animal welfare through a clean and user-friendly system.  

I first worked on this project as part of my coursework, and later expanded it during my **System Analysis and Design (CSE 3411)** course. Over time, I added several new features and improvements, and this version represents the final build.
